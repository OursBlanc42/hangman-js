# Hangman Game (JS)

A hangman game running locally in JavaScript.

## Intro
This project was created after my training at Holberton School as a way to practice JavaScript and review some front-end concepts on my own, including DOM manipulation.
I developed it in a particular environment (office setup without admin rights) that didnâ€™t allow me to run a server, hence a small workaround to make it run locally only.

## Feature
- Playable directly in the browser
- Word library in **French** (approx 100 words)
- Visual life system (with heart, and with small drawings)
- Visual effect if game over or victory

## Preview
Here is a quick preview of the game:

## Todo / Ideas

- Show the answer when the game is over
- Make the UI mobile responsive
- Option to add custom words with persistence
- Add language switch (English / French / others)
- Code improvements
